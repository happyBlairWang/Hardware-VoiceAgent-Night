Bridge: ESP32 microphone -> AssemblyAI Voice Agent -> Mac speakers + live web UI.

  ws://<mac>:8080/      the ESP32 pushes raw 24 kHz 16-bit PCM here
  ws://<mac>:8080/ui    the browser page subscribes to transcripts here
  http://localhost:8081/ui.html   the page itself

Run:  ~/esp-tools/bin/python -u relay.py

Echo control (half-duplex)
--------------------------
The mic and the speakers share a room, so the agent hears itself and replies
to its own voice. We hold the microphone shut for as long as the operator is
actually speaking. Note that reply.done fires well BEFORE the sound finishes
playing -- audio arrives faster than real time -- so the gate is driven by the
duration of audio queued for playback, not by the message. TAIL_S covers the
speaker -> air -> microphone flight time and the room's reverb.

Protocol notes (verified live; the docs omit these):
  * session.update nests under "session"; the server echoes it back as "config"
  * outbound audio -> {"type":"input.audio","audio": b64}
  * inbound  audio -> {"type":"reply.audio","data":  b64}
  * ONLY 24000 Hz works; other rates are accepted, then fail with internal_error

Echo control
------------
The authoritative gate is on the ESP32, which can see its own DAC buffer and
therefore knows when sound is genuinely still leaving the speaker. The window
kept here is only a coarse backstop -- relay-side timing runs early by the
device buffer depth plus the network hop, which is exactly how the operator
used to end up transcribing itself.
